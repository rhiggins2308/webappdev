                <br>
                <h2><u>18. REPLACEMENTS / SUBSTITUTES</u></h2>
                <p>Teams playing in Division 1A, 1B and 1C and J2 may tog out up to five additional players, (a club must not have more than 20 players togged) who may act as substitute replacements, subject to Law 3 of the Laws of the Game.</p>
                <p>A team should have five players who can play in front row positions, two of whom can play hooker and three of whom can play prop.</p>
                <p>All front row players must have a “P” or “H” after their names when panels / team sheets are submitted.</p>
                <p>Rolling substitutions as detailed below shall be permitted in Division 1A, 1B and 1C, II, the Senior League, the Senior Cup, the Cawley Cup, the Curley Cup, the Ard na Cregg Cup and the Heineken Junior Cup and Plate.</p>
                <p>The Under 19 scrum laws will apply in Division II.</p>
                <h3>ROLLING SUBSTITUTIONS</h3>
                <p>A maximum of 12 substitutions (Changes) per team per match shall be allowed using 12 substitution cards.</p>
                <p>Changes under this Law shall include blood replacements and injuries; indeed any time one player replaces another player from the same team other than front-row replacements required after a yellow card (see 6. below).</p>
                <p>When a player has a blood injury and is replaced by another player and then returns to the field of play within the permitted time that will count as 2 changes and will require the use of two cards.</p>
                <p>When a player is sent from the field of play under a red card that is NOT a change and will not require a card.</p>
                <p>When a player is temporarily suspended under a yellow card and leaves the field of play that is NOT a change and will not require a card.</p>
                <p>When a scrum is ordered during the temporary suspension of a front-row player (Player A), and as a result a player (Player B) is required to leave the field to allow another front-row player (Player C) to come on NO card is required.</p>
                <p>If, at the end of the period of temporary suspension, Player A resumes and Player C leaves the field, then NO card is required.<br>Player B returning to the field of play does NOT require a card.</p>
                <p>If, however, the team opts to leave Player C on at the end of the temporary suspension period instead of Player A returning then a card IS required.</p>
                <p>After all 12 cards have been used, no further changes will be allowed for whatever reason including injuries. If, after the 12 changes have been made there is any reason for a player to leave the field of play, the team must play on with one less player. Uncontested scrums will apply if this involves a front-row player.</p>
                
                <h4>Procedural Guideline for the Administration and Control of Rolling Substitutions:</h4>
                <p>Each team will be given a set of home cards (12) and away cards (12). These cards are contained within this package.</p>
                <p>It is the responsibility of the home team to provide the rolling sub cards for both the home team and the away team on a match day.</p>
                <p>If a team require a replacement set of cards, or individual replacement cards, a charge will be applied by the Connacht Branch.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During Matches:</p>
                <p>Each team will have a set (12) of cards (each set will be a different colour, green for away team and blue for the home team)</p>
                <p>Each team shall appoint its responsible person (e.g. Coach) who shall be required to hand the appropriate change card in the correct sequence to the referee, touch judge, or 4th official. This must happen before each change takes place and a player enters the field of play. There is no requirement to record or write anything on the card.</p>
                <p>The referee, touch judge, or 4th official shall receive and retain the cards during the match and shall monitor each team’s use of its changes. The referee is not required to record any information but shall retain the submitted cards until after the end of the match.</p>
